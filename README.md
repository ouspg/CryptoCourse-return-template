**Student name:** 

*Give at least above information to this file. You can remove all below if you like, and add some own general instructions/information if you like.*


## What is this repository for?

This repository is meant for returning all of the weekly exercises during the course.

The actual instructions for exercises are [here.](https://github.com/ouspg/CryptoCourse)

You will update and add all of your work on from the exercises into this repository during the course.


## How to proceed?

There is corresponding folder for each exercise in this repository.

There is template for text (README.md) in each template folder. You can fill it as you like, but include at least task numbers and possible subnumbers, answering what is required on corresponding task.

You can create folder named *src* for possible source code in each folder.

You can create folder named *img* for possible images/screenshots in each folder.

It is recommended to do as described above, but it is not required (= you can add more things if you like).


Check [cheat sheet](https://github.github.com/training-kit/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf) if you need a refresher on how to use Git. 

If you have barely edited Markdown files, [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a good free software for editing and showing live preview of it. It works on Windows, Linux and Mac. It is also installed on to the virtual machine (VSCodium version, without trackers).

You can look for short guide of Markdown syntax available in [here.](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

## When to proceed?

There is a deadline for each weekly exercise.

When you have done the exercises of corresponding week, you have to return link (URL) of this repository into [Moodle](https://moodle.oulu.fi) into corresponding returning box ***before deadline***, which is before next supported session.

Note: You can return link beforehand and edit corresponding exercise still here, as long as it has been done before deadline.

In practice, if you have done all of the nine (9) exercises, you return this same link nine (9) times for different return boxes.

This is because:

 * We can track, if you have done the corresponding exercise in each time. We know that there is something to review.

 * We can link correct person to correct repository (= We know, who has actually edited this repository)

 * There are people, who might only take weekly questionnaires

 * Private GitHub repositories can be more accessible than one hundred zip files.

 Just take care that you have returned link before deadline, and corresponding weekly exercise has been completed in here.
